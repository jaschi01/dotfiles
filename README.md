The setup for my dotfile repo is based upon the following article:

There are some dotfiles here that are not aplicable to all my systems.  This is mainly
including the i3 and polybar stuff.  For systems that do not sure then (mostly my RPi) they will just be unused files on the system.  

The following packages need to be installed:
- git
- vim
- i3
- polybar (I ended up having to build this from souce for Ubuntu)
- google-chrome
- urxvt
- nitrogen (wallpapers)
